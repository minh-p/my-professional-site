** Motivation
I decided to become a better programmer. I think that coding to make CRUD apps is a path to being replaceable. Plus, as I'm heading to major Computer Science and Engineering at UCI, I have decided to begin creating C++ projects that reinforce the fundamentals of programming fields. With my current resources, I think I can do graphics, and make a game from scratch. Once I finish messing around with [[https://www.libsdl.org/][Simple DirectMedia Layer]] (SDL), I am probably going to create a web socket.
** About SDL
SDL is a cross-platform development library for graphical application that needs low level access to hardware. It is used as a library for several game engines and therefore for many games. I also heard that SDL is known for being a layer of abstraction so that I won't have to mess with specific lower level graphics API such as vulkan or d3d11. SDL is a library to make cross platform computer graphics application. As well, learning to use this library means knowing the fundamentals of computer graphics.
I proceed to dive head first into the documentation, which I realize I have no idea what I am looking at: A series of C functions organized into categories that I can't put together and don't understand. Indeed, purely looking at documentation is only possible when you're used to the documentation have well established a basic understanding of what the library do and the underlying concepts around it. Luckily, being a popular library, there are tutorials. I decide to take things slow to become competent. Right now, I am nothing. I am worthless.
** Following Tutorial and Projects
I've made [[https://github.com/minh-p/SDLTrial][SDLTrial]], my GitHub repository to learn C/C++ tooling and as well the SDL library. I hope that this will build my resume and of course help anyone who's also learning the SDL library as well. As of the moment of creating this post, I have succesfully completed "Hello World", or showing a triangle on screen! Check out [[https://github.com/minh-p/SDLTrial/tree/main/Triangle][Triangle]].
As well, I am using [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]]. The repository features setting development and compilation up the nix way with [[https://github.com/minh-p/SDLTrial/blob/main/Triangle/default.nix][default.nix]] and [[https://github.com/minh-p/SDLTrial/blob/main/flake.nix][flake.nix]] alongside [[https://github.com/minh-p/SDLTrial/blob/main/Triangle/CMakeLists.txt][CMake]].

** Resources I Have
For individual units, I have the Albert practice, of which I will probably redo the topic that I miss the most on the practice exam.
I think I should attend the review session this weekend and just do a mock exam.
** Schedules
*** April 16th, 2025
- I am reviewing Electromagnetism by going over the Course and Exam Descriptions 2024.
** Units
*** Unit 12: Magnetism and Electromagnetism
- Albert: [[id:12052f78-ede1-4b21-a953-77aefb7ae037][#4 Electromagnetism Albert]]
**** Core Concepts
- Relationships between moving charges, the magnetic fields they generate, and the magnetic forces that act on other moving charges in those fields.
- Students are to explain the steps that lead from the equation, law, or physical principle to the justification of their claim on the FRQ.
***** Right Hand Rules
****** Moving Charges/Current in a wire affected by magnetic field - e.g. magnetic force on moving charges
When charges are sitting still, they are unaffected by magnetic fields. As soon as they begin to move, the magnetic field pushes on them. To use this mnemonic: your index finger is the direction of the moving charge, your middle finger is the magnetic field/field lines, and your thumb is the magnetic force, F.

F is the direction of the force that will be applied to the moving charge. In this question,
****** Magnetic Field caused by current in a wire (nothing about force)
Thumb and wrap your hand around a wire.
This right hand rule is also used in this problem but it's given to you. The magnetic field is either in or out depending on which side of the wire you're on.
***** 12.1 Magnetic Fields
- Understand the Right Hand rule: for moving charge, along a current wire.
- Understand magnets: magnetization, dipoles, magnetic domains, magnetic field alignment. Magnets go from North to South on the outside and South to North on the inside. Outside a magnetic field, magnetic domains magnetized point to the South, while inside a magnetic field, it points to North.
- Magnetic field is a vector field - produced by magnetic dipoles or combination thereof but never by monopole. It forms closed loop. As well, South never exists without North and vice versa. There's always a dipole for magnetic fields.
- Magnetic behavior of a material: dipoles result from the circular or rotational motion of electric charges: the motion of electrons. Permanent magnetism and incuded magnetism are system properties that both result from the alignment of magnetic dipoles within a system.
- Material composition: ferromagnetic materials like iron, nickel, cobalt are permanently magnetized by an external field; paramagnetic materials such as aluminum, titanium, and magnesium interact weakly with an external magnetic field but then doesn't after the field is removed.
- Magnetic permeability: a measurement of the amount of magnetization in a material in response to an external magnetic field. A higher magnetic permeability means higher occurence of a material changing its magnetic properties. For example, iron has high permeability.
***** 12.2 Magnetism and Moving Charges
- Moving charge and magnetic field: a single moving charge object produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field at a particular point produced by a moving charged object depends on the object's velocity and distance between the point and the object.
- The magnitude of a magnetic field is maxmimum when the velocity vector and the position vector from that object to the point in space are perpendicular.
- Know \(F_b = qvB\sin{\theta}\). The magnetic force is porportional to q, v, B. It is at the maximum when \(\theta = 90^{o}\).
- The Hall Effect: the potential difference created in a conductor by an external magnetic field that has a component perpendicular to the direction of charges moving in the conductor. TLDR: electrons moving, starts moving in another direction because of magnetic force from its interaction with a magnetic field. Then electrons create potential with the other side that lacks negative charge in a conductor/conducting material.
***** 12.3 Magnetism and Current-Carrying Wire
- \(B = \frac{\mu_o I}{2\pi r}\). Ampere's Law.
- \(F_B = BI\ell\sin{\theta{}}\). Finding the magnetic force along a current carrying wire.
***** 12.4: Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law
- Magnetic flux: amount of the component of a magnetic field that is perpendicular to a cross-sectional area.
- \(\Phi_B = BA\cos{\theta}\). \(\Phi_B\) is the magnetic flux; it is proportional to \(B\), the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the surface, and \(A\), the cross-sectional area of the surface.
  - The area vector is defined to be perpendicular to the plane of the surface and directed outward from a closed surface.
  - The sign of a magnetic flux indicates whether the magnetic field is parallel to or antiparallel to the area vector.
- \(|\mathcal{E}| = |\frac{\Delta\Phi_B}{\Delta t}|\) Faraday's Law: changing magnetic flux and induced \(\mathcal{E}\). Magnetic field have to change for there to be induced \(\mathcal{E}\) and therefore current.
- \(\mathcal{E} = -\frac{\Delta \Phi_B}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta(BA\cos{\theta})}{\Delta t}\) Lenz's Law: Determining the direction of an induced \(\mathcal{E}\). resulting from a changing \(\Phi_B\).
- An induced \(\mathcal{E}\) generates a current that creates a magnetic field that opposes the change in \(\Phi_B\). You can also use the right-hand rule to determine the relatioship between current, \(\mathcal{E}\), and \(\Phi_B\).
- \(\mathcal{E} = B\ell v\). Common equation.
- An example of electromagnetic induction: conducting rod on conducting rails in a region with uniform magnetic field.

The main problem is despair not "consistency" nor the good 'ol advice "just be self-disciplined".

Like a thousand other people, I have grand ambitions. I won't deny. Indeed half of my drive is motivated by greed. But the other half, which I hope will increase even more over greed is the love for work itself. After all, you can have a thousand or million other people with the same ambitions: to become wealthy, travel the world, indulge in materialism, and achieve financial freedom and independence. But what differs is the execution and taking advantage of what we are initially given in life, which leads us to the first point.
** Being Grateful
Those who lives in the Western hemispshere of the globe lives an privileged life. Though yes inequality persists due to capitalism and its compounding effects across generation. Yet it should not ever be taken for granted. At least for me I am lucky to have a home and a loving family who built my foundation of morality, my physical body, and biology. Living in the United States means freedom and the potential for social mobility. But, it is also a cutthroat, competitive world. You just have to accept that fact.

It is not my place to say this but it is critically necessary to have a positive perspective on life especially if you're young. There is still so much time you can afford to change your circumstances. Take what you have and do what you can. Give thanks to the material blessings and if not, then the spiritual blessings from the Divine. If you do not believe in God, then they would be the blessings from seemingly supernatural things. And if you're a determinist like Sam Harris, then take a bet on your biology, of the capability of the human vessel for consciousness.
** Modern Society's Rot
We live in a capitalistic world where our attention and time is corporate currency. It is almost like a debuff, a term you would hear in video games. In another word, it is so easy to develop recessive habits from the Internet. Internet overconsumption and addiction lead to a multitude of other things very easily like pornography addiction, social media addiction, video games addiction, and video media addiction. Frankly, I forsee half the battle in my early adult years is the battle against what I see and hear every single day. Hence, success is going to be denied to every single individual who does not produce proactively in place of non-purposeful consumption. Truly I wish to never have opened a program on any device except a desktop/laptop computer, any tool I could actually get some work done instead of making me addicted.
** Patience and Why "Just Be Disciplined" Is Horrible Advice
One of my least favorite advice to give and receive is, "just be disciplined". We are constantly motivated either through survival, competition, or social harmony and daily traditions. I do not know how people do it. I have never been disciplined for as long as a month without any motivation. But I do know that the mindset has to be changed first. Frankly, if I cannot work on myself. That is, to constantly self-troubleshoot and self-reinvent, then I am in world full of hurt. It truly takes a lot of grit to be self-disciplined, which that is truly a goal after months and years. But it takes time, patience, and the problem is consistency. But you'll just have to accept that you won't be consistent. Rather, the primary problem is despair, the worst human condition especially if you're fighting through alone or with little support and ignorance.

In Christianity, Demons want people to be despaired, but God wants to not only repair us but construct a superior state of being that is optimist and even selfless. But enough evangelizing, the problem with aiming for consistency is that without the necessary reminders of affirmations \mdash that everything is going to be fine \mdash and knowing that you have to develop your patience, you are constantly aiming for perfection that cannot be achieved.

There's a term I would like to coin, a standard, involuntary event. It is frictional stagnation, which I derive from the economic term, "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_unemployment][structural unemployment]]". For instance, it is okay to miss a few days at the gym. In fact, attending gym sessions once every two weeks is completely fine. Being suboptimal and below standard is perfectly fine when you are first beginning a journey or getting back into it. But do not despair. Jesus has come down to Earth because we make mistakes. And as well in the Atheist's perspective, you would be arrogant to think you're better than people who have been in the game for a long time. Therefore, you should always try to neutralize your emotions: if you're feeling arrogant, tone it down else you will lose discipline; if you're a failure, accept that you are yet be perfectly fine existing with these thoughts since they're the truth. Great! At rock bottom, the only way is up. Care optimistically for fear that you will be lazy.
** Warnings Against Laziness
If you live a life in laziness, then that means you are already in despair. Fix yourself. "Idle hands are the Devil's Workshop" (Proverbs 16:27). If you don't work, you won't live. If you don't put food on the table, you will starve and die. Life is short, don't waste it. But have patience that you will be more competent and less lazy every day. Do not fear. Do not be despaired.
** Attention Is a Limited Resource. Avoid Superficial Actions
You can do many things in the name of self-improvement. However, this wouldn't fix your life in large magnitude. It will make your more healthy. But the major problems at hand won't be fixed for you to be consistent at those habits. And as well, the successful people you know aren't doing the top 10 successful habits and $1 billion dollar morning routines. Most of them are hoaxes created by Self-Improvement coach, something that is intangible and mostly unrealistic. I would like to outsource this part to a video by Andrew Kirby, /[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPaT6V3Suc&t=4s][The Sick Truth About Self-Improvement]]/.
** Practical Steps Forward
The solution is pretty simple. It is to minimize digital footprint. It is time to focus. It is time to become ferocious. I might not have had the best blessings growing up. But I am grateful. What I have to do now is constantly work toward self-mastery. What I cannot fight, I will run away from.
1. Only use phones for their original purpose which is mobile communications.
2. Use saved time to not only be productive but healthy habits especially sleep and working out.
3. To avoid procrastination, get at least some progress on the most important problem.
4. Most importantly, be constantly reminded of your resolutions. Make it a ritual. A short list to know what you must be up to.
5. Run away from the bed and your phone.
6. Focus on your most important problem at hands rather than superficial things.
** What If I Mess Up?
Again, it is what I said about despair. Instead of being and not doing anything, you should attempt self-troubleshoot. Perhaps the reason you did not do any work today is and mostly always because of your dopamine level be sky high due to social and video media consumption and the lack of sleep. Take rest early today and don't look at useless stuff tomorrow. As always, if you know your life is going to require a high standard, such as a high paying job. Maybe take a step back and be honest to your boss. Ask for another opportunity. But most likely, you haven't even gotten that job or doing properly your own business anyways. So, focus on learning, improving, and self-optimizing.

## Technical Language Fluency {#technical-language-fluency}

Here's a short summary of my current experience with programming and coding as of March 2025.


### Right Now {#right-now}

I'm currently learning C/C++. [C++ Programming: Starting with Simple DirectMedia Library (SDL 3)]({{< relref "C++ Programming Starting with SDL" >}})


### Self Learned {#self-learned}

I have experience in Lua, Python, and Javascript.
In 6th grade before I came to the U.S., I began programming on Roblox with the Lua Programming Language. I got really good and freelanced myself, creating main component UIs for a _My Hero Academia_ roleplay game. I received $178 dollars for freelancing. Besides this, up until now I was trying to create a school [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) [web app](https://projarchive.netlify.app/home), this project ultimately was put on a hold as I lacked interest and saw that time is better invested to learn lower level programming and fundamentals.


### High School {#high-school}

Throughout my High School, I went through 3 years of the Computer Science pathway. I completed AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A. Both with a 4. AP Computer Science A taught me formally the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming through the Java language on [Code.org](https://code.org/).


## Language Fluency {#language-fluency}

I am of course fluent in Vietnamese. During my High School years, I also took Spanish. I am officially trilingual as per California Seal of Biliteracy.


## The Things I Use to Code {#the-things-i-use-to-code}

Rather than coding, I became obsessed with other things ha ha. Like Vim, and then Evil mode on Emacs. As well, I've dabbled into Linux. Right now, I'm running on my personal machine [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). Here are my NixOs and Emacs dotfiles LOL:

-   [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/minh-p/doom-emacs-config)
-   [Dotfiles](https://github.com/minh-p/nixosNixOS): including [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway), [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/), [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).

Also, I have a sweet linux setup (Sway, NixOS). Look at this:

Learning C++ is something I've put off because of distractions and procrastination. During this winter break as I experience the numb sensation of time passing, I am motivated to focus on learning C++ early during this break. At the same time, I feel inclined to tell my future self and anybody else that comes to this post the mental obstacles that naturally appear as you are learning something new in programming.


## C++ Resources - [C++ Embedded Engineering Roadmap](https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap?tab=readme-ov-file#-c-1) {#c-plus-plus-resources-c-plus-plus-embedded-engineering-roadmap}

This is where I'm thinking I should start. I will trust the process and look through all of this, skipping the general high level programming ideas.


## My story of procrastination {#my-story-of-procrastination}

It was probably the high expectation I put on myself with eclipsing ego that I was a chronic procrastinator during my weekends. During my High School years, I've wasted countless hours: when I wake up on a Saturday or Sunday, my brain just pauses and look at my phone for hours and then when I open my eyes it was already 3 in the afternoon. Demotivated, I continued to be careless. This habit has not magically removed itself despite any self-improvement voodoo, but it has certainly improved. The only way out was through reflection, through episodes where I regret doing what I did, wasting my potential that my mind finally concedes and signals that I have to change bit by bit to survive in the real world.


## Ego {#ego}

Is this humble topic good enough to befit me? That is the wrong question yet my mind asks that subconsciously. I was not prepared mentally to humble myself and learn everything systematically, trusting the process. I want to move on to the newest and greatest thing despite not having the time to understand the fundamentals.


## Time Management {#time-management}

Eventually, I do not want to just focus on learning during the break. I understand I would have other responsiblities like my part-time job and the 4 units quarter studies at UCI. If I have to minimize my shift for learning then I would. This was the mistake I made during my High School years. Despite doing everything I could, I was only able to start learning at 8:30 PM. Instead of trying to fix the problem I promptly gave up. Looking back there were many things I could do: (1) make my learning more efficient, (2) utilize the weekends to finish work early, (3) minimize distractions and video games; stop escaping reality. I was so incredibly naive and stupid. I should have had blinding confidence to change things the way they were, and even they did not work, I should continue finding ways to change. God delivered humans on this earth so that they have limitless potential.


## There's So Much to Learn {#there-s-so-much-to-learn}

Yes, many people base their career off of understanding C++ and using it. Of course there's a lot to learn and master. Trust the process else I will never get started, not even mastery. The demand is high and the supply is short for a reason.

The main problem is despair not "consistency" nor the good 'ol advice "just be self-disciplined".

Like a thousand other people, I have grand ambitions. I won't deny. Indeed half of my drive is motivated by greed. But the other half, which I hope will increase even more over greed is the love for work itself. After all, you can have a thousand or million other people with the same ambitions: to become wealthy, travel the world, indulge in materialism, and achieve financial freedom and independence. But what differs is the execution and taking advantage of what we are initially given in life, which leads us to the first point.


## Being Grateful {#being-grateful}

Those who lives in the Western hemispshere of the globe lives an privileged life. Though yes inequality persists due to capitalism and its compounding effects across generation. Yet it should not ever be taken for granted. At least for me I am lucky to have a home and a loving family who built my foundation of morality, my physical body, and biology. Living in the United States means freedom and the potential for social mobility. But, it is also a cutthroat, competitive world. You just have to accept that fact.

It is not my place to say this but it is critically necessary to have a positive perspective on life especially if you're young. There is still so much time you can afford to change your circumstances. Take what you have and do what you can. Give thanks to the material blessings and if not, then the spiritual blessings from the Divine. If you do not believe in God, then they would be the blessings from seemingly supernatural things. And if you're a determinist like Sam Harris, then take a bet on your biology, of the capability of the human vessel for consciousness.


## Modern Society's Rot {#modern-society-s-rot}

We live in a capitalistic world where our attention and time is corporate currency. It is almost like a debuff, a term you would hear in video games. In another word, it is so easy to develop recessive habits from the Internet. Internet overconsumption and addiction lead to a multitude of other things very easily like pornography addiction, social media addiction, video games addiction, and video media addiction. Frankly, I forsee half the battle in my early adult years is the battle against what I see and hear every single day. Hence, success is going to be denied to every single individual who does not produce proactively in place of non-purposeful consumption. Truly I wish to never have opened a program on any device except a desktop/laptop computer, any tool I could actually get some work done instead of making me addicted.


## Patience and Why "Just Be Disciplined" Is Horrible Advice {#patience-and-why-just-be-disciplined-is-horrible-advice}

One of my least favorite advice to give and receive is, "just be disciplined". We are constantly motivated either through survival, competition, or social harmony and daily traditions. I do not know how people do it. I have never been disciplined for as long as a month without any motivation. But I do know that the mindset has to be changed first. Frankly, if I cannot work on myself. That is, to constantly self-troubleshoot and self-reinvent, then I am in world full of hurt. It truly takes a lot of grit to be self-disciplined, which that is truly a goal after months and years. But it takes time, patience, and the problem is consistency. But you'll just have to accept that you won't be consistent. Rather, the primary problem is despair, the worst human condition especially if you're fighting through alone or with little support and ignorance.

In Christianity, Demons want people to be despaired, but God wants to not only repair us but construct a superior state of being that is optimist and even selfless. But enough evangelizing, the problem with aiming for consistency is that without the necessary reminders of affirmations &mdash; that everything is going to be fine &mdash; and knowing that you have to develop your patience, you are constantly aiming for perfection that cannot be achieved.

There's a term I would like to coin, a standard, involuntary event. It is frictional stagnation, which I derive from the economic term, "[structural unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_unemployment)". For instance, it is okay to miss a few days at the gym. In fact, attending gym sessions once every two weeks is completely fine. Being suboptimal and below standard is perfectly fine when you are first beginning a journey or getting back into it. But do not despair. Jesus has come down to Earth because we make mistakes. And as well in the Atheist's perspective, you would be arrogant to think you're better than people who have been in the game for a long time. Therefore, you should always try to neutralize your emotions: if you're feeling arrogant, tone it down else you will lose discipline; if you're a failure, accept that you are yet be perfectly fine existing with these thoughts since they're the truth. Great! At rock bottom, the only way is up. Care optimistically for fear that you will be lazy.


## Warnings Against Laziness {#warnings-against-laziness}

If you live a life in laziness, then that means you are already in despair. Fix yourself. "Idle hands are the Devil's Workshop" (Proverbs 16:27). If you don't work, you won't live. If you don't put food on the table, you will starve and die. Life is short, don't waste it. But have patience that you will be more competent and less lazy every day. Do not fear. Do not be despaired.


## Attention Is a Limited Resource. Avoid Superficial Actions {#attention-is-a-limited-resource-dot-avoid-superficial-actions}

You can do many things in the name of self-improvement. However, this wouldn't fix your life in large magnitude. It will make your more healthy. But the major problems at hand won't be fixed for you to be consistent at those habits. And as well, the successful people you know aren't doing the top 10 successful habits and $1 billion dollar morning routines. Most of them are hoaxes created by Self-Improvement coach, something that is intangible and mostly unrealistic. I would like to outsource this part to a video by Andrew Kirby, _[The Sick Truth About Self-Improvement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPaT6V3Suc&t=4s)_.


## Practical Steps Forward {#practical-steps-forward}

The solution is pretty simple. It is to minimize digital footprint. It is time to focus. It is time to become ferocious. I might not have had the best blessings growing up. But I am grateful. What I have to do now is constantly work toward self-mastery. What I cannot fight, I will run away from.

1.  Only use phones for their original purpose which is mobile communications.
2.  Use saved time to not only be productive but healthy habits especially sleep and working out.
3.  To avoid procrastination, get at least some progress on the most important problem.
4.  Most importantly, be constantly reminded of your resolutions. Make it a ritual. A short list to know what you must be up to.
5.  Run away from the bed and your phone.
6.  Focus on your most important problem at hands rather than superficial things.


## What If I Mess Up? {#what-if-i-mess-up}

Again, it is what I said about despair. Instead of being and not doing anything, you should attempt self-troubleshoot. Perhaps the reason you did not do any work today is and mostly always because of your dopamine level be sky high due to social and video media consumption and the lack of sleep. Take rest early today and don't look at useless stuff tomorrow. As always, if you know your life is going to require a high standard, such as a high paying job. Maybe take a step back and be honest to your boss. Ask for another opportunity. But most likely, you haven't even gotten that job or doing properly your own business anyways. So, focus on learning, improving, and self-optimizing.
